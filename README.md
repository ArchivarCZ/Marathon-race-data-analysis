# Marathon-race-data-analysis

We start this analysis with importing the two text files. Cleaning and processing the data so that we can save it into a new csv file cleaned_df. We continue with an exploratory data analysis for different atributes. We analyze one racer and compare him with top 10 percentile of his division.
